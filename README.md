# 📚 Restaurant Backend Project

## 📖 Description
This backend project is designed for a restaurant management system, utilizing a RESTful API and a MySQL database. The backend is handled by the **Golden Boys** team, while the frontend will be managed by an external company. This modular approach ensures smooth scaling and easy maintenance.

**Features:**
- User authentication using **JWT** for secure access control.
- **Order management** with real-time updates for kitchen and customer interaction.
- **Menu management** with CRUD operations for dishes, daily menus, and specials.
- **Payment processing integration** (can be expanded in the future).
- Built with **Sequelize ORM** for interaction with the MySQL database.

## 🚧 Project Status
**Current Status**: In development. New features are being added regularly. Keep an eye on the repository for updates.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **VS Code**: IDE for development.
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for the backend.
- **Express.js**: Framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **Sequelize**: ORM for MySQL database interaction.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for storing restaurant data.
- **Postman/Thunder Client**: Tools for testing and debugging APIs.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure user authentication.
- **bcrypt**: For password hashing.
